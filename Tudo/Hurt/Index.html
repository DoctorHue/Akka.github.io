			<p> 
				I hurt myself today<br>
			    To see if I still feel<br>
                I focus on the pain<br>
                The only thing that's real<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The needle tears a hole<br>
				The old familiar sting<br>
			    Try to kill it all away<br>
			    But I remember everything<br>
			</p>
		<strong>
			<p>
				What have I become<br>
			    My sweetest friend<br>
				Everyone I know<br>
				Goes away in the end<br>
			</p>
		</strong>
		<i>	
			<p>
				And you could have it all<br>
				My empire of dirt<br>
				I will let you down<br>
				I will make you hurt<br>
		    </p>
		</i>
			<p>
				I wear this crown of thorns<br>
				Upon my liars chair<br>
				Full of broken thoughts<br>
				I cannot repair<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Beneath the stains of time<br>
				The feelings disappear<br>
				You are someone else<br>
				I am still right here<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				What have I become<br>
				My sweetest friend<br>
				Everyone I know<br>
				Goes away in the end<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				And you could have it all<br>
				My empire of dirt<br>
				I will let you down<br>
				I will make you hurt<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				If I could start again<br>
				A million miles away<br>
				I will keep myself<br>
				I would find a way<br>
			</p>
		</big>
