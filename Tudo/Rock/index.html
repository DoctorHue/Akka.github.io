	<br>
	She's got a smile it seems to me<br>
	Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
	Where everything<br>
	Was as fresh as the bright blue sky<br>
	Now and then when I see her face<br>
	She takes me away to that special place<br>
	And if I'd stare too long<br>
	I'd probably break down and cry<br>
	Oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet child o' mine<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet love of mine<br>
	She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
	As if they thought of rain<br>
	I hate to look into those eyes<br>
	And see an ounce of pain<br>
	Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br>
	Where as a child I'd hide<br>
	And pray for the thunder<br>
	And the rain<br>
	To quietly pass me by<br>
	Oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet child o' mine<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet love of mine<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet child o' mine<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet love of mine<br>
	Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
	Sweet child o' mine<br>
	Oh yeah yeah <br>
	Oh oh sweet love of mine<br>
	Where do we go?<br>
	Where do we go now?<br>
	Where do we go?<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Where do we go?<br>
	(Where do we go now?) <br>
	Oh where do we go now? (Where do we go?)<br>
	Where do we go? (Sweet child)<br>
	Oh where do we go now?<br>
	Ay ay ay ay (where do we go now, where do we go) <br>
	Oh where do we go now?	<br>
	Where do we go?<br>
	Oh, where do we go now?<br>
	Oh, where do we go?<br>
	Oh where do we go now?<br>
	Where do we go?<br>
	Oh, where do we go now?<br>
	No, no, no, no, no, no<br>
	Sweet child<br>
	Sweet child of mine<br>

Come as you are, as you were<br>
As I want you to be<br>
As a friend, as a friend<br>
As an known enemy<br>
Take your time, hurry up<br>
The choice is yours, don't be late<br>
Take a rest as a friend<br>
As an old<br>
Memoria, memoria<br>
Memoria, memoria<br>
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach<br>
As I want you to be<br>
As a trend, as a friend<br>
As an old<br>
Memoria, memoria<br>
Memoria, memoria<br>
And I swear that I don't have a gun<br>
No I don't have a gun<br>
No I don't have a gun<br>
Memoria, memoria<br>

Can anybody find me somebody to love?<br>
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little<br>
Can barely stand on my feet<br>
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)<br>
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)<br>
I have spent all my years in believing you<br>
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!<br>
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)<br>
Can anybody find me somebody to love?<br>
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life<br>
I work 'til I ache in my bones<br>
At the end (at the end of the day)<br>
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own<br>
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)<br>
And I start to pray<br>
'Til the tears run down from my eyes<br>
Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody<br>
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?<br>
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try<br>
But everybody wants to put me down<br>
They say I'm going crazy<br>
They say I got a lot of water in my brain<br>
Ah, got no common sense<br>
I got nobody left to believe in<br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
Oh, Lord<br>
Ooh somebody, ooh somebody<br>
Can anybody find me somebody to love?<br>
(Can anybody find me someone to love)<br>
Got no feel, I got no rhythm<br>
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)<br>
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)<br>
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)<br>
I just gotta get out of this prison cell<br>
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love love love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Find me somebody to love<br>
Somebody somebody somebody somebody<br>
Somebody find me<br>
